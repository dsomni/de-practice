# Computational Practicum for DE Course Fall 2021

## Task Description

1. Given the initial value problem with the ODE of the first order and some
interval:
    y' = f(x,y)
    y(x0) = y0
    x0 <= x <= X

2. Construct following approximations of the solution
of a given initial value problem: Euler’s method, improved Euler’s method, Runge-Kutta method.
(provide the possibility of changing the initial
conditions).

3. Implement the exact solution of an IVP in your application.

4. Provide data visualization capability (charts plotting) in the user interface of
your application.

5. Investigate the convergence of these numerical methods on different grid
sizes (provide the possibility of changing the number of grid steps).

6. Compare approximation errors of these methods plotting the corresponding
chart for different grid sizes (provide the possibility of changing the range of
grid steps).


## How to run

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

Then you can serve it using `serve -s build`
